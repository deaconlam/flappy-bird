A classic Flappy Bird game recreated with modern UI and new twists based on Pygame.

# New Twists
• Gravity Flip

After the player has progressed a certain time in the game, a prompt appears:
"Gravity Flip incoming." Once activated, the game’s gravity is reversed. Instead of 
falling when idle, the bird will now slowly float upward. Pressing the space bar 
will cause the bird to flap downward instead.

• Invulnerable Mode

Occasionally, a special item will spawn at random as the player advances. When 
the bird collects this item, it enters Invulnerability Mode for 15 seconds. During 
this time, the bird can fly straight through pipes without taking damage, giving 
players a brief but powerful advantage.
